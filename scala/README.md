## Scala track

On this collaborative learning track, we're familiarizing ourselves with Scala,
used in a sane and idiomatic way. We're starting off doing one exercise a week,
with the responsibility for preparing the exercise and materials rotating
among the participants.

Mikael will arrange an one-hour telco for this every Friday, for now. We'll 
spend half of it going over the previous exercise, and half on the next one.

This is an agile learning track, so the participants will make whatever changes
are necessary whenever they are necessary, to make things work.

Everybody is welcome to join, but we're not actively advertising until we're
happy that we can scale this process with the amount of people we're starting
with.
